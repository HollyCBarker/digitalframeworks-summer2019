# Process for cleaning #

I cross-referenced a small sample of facility deficiency listings against surveys available on the CMS website to see whether there were any discrepancies. (There were not).

I then removed several facility surveys that were conducted outside of the date range intended to be captured. 

I created a count column for the number of times the facility appeared in the list (so that I could then use the dates of the surveys to determine how many times each facility was surveyed).

I broke out the survey dates by day, month, year.  I did this because I thought I might want to look into whether there were any trends realted to when surveys were conducted.

The CMS data was in reasonably good shape at the outset, so did not require extensive clean-up.

I have attached the cleaned-up file. I am providing the link to the csv file here, as it was too large to upload to GitHub: https://data.medicare.gov/Nursing-Home-Compare/Deficiencies-Displayed-on-Nursing-Home-Compare-Cyc/3j8m-gmpk
