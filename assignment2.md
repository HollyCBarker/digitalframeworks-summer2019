# Assignment 2 
I am curious about the language used to express sympathy following mass shootings and whether there are any discernable trends in the way people talk about mass shootings depending on the victim demographics or the nature or location of the shootings.

The data would need to include the common name of the shooting, the geographic location, the number of victims injured and killed, the type of location where the shooting occurred, and targeted demographic (if known).

I would focus on the words used by national leadership (Senate and House leadership and the President)

The following is a link to a sample data set for President Trumpâ€™s Twitter responses to 5 shootings https://drive.google.com/open?id=1c2vBPHpoBcfOP5RvOdn9TJbN_OLzWjgT
